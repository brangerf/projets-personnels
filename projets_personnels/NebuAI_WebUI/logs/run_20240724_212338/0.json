Proposed by the European Commission on 21 April 2021 and not yet enacted, it would introduce a common regulatory and legal framework for artificial intelligence. Its scope would encompass all types of artificial intelligence in a broad range of sectors\n(exceptions include AI systems used solely for military, national security, research, and non-professional purpose). As a piece of product regulation, it would not confer rights on individuals, but would regulate the providers of AI systems, and entities using AI in a professional context.The proposed EU Artificial Intelligence Act aims to classify and regulate artificial intelligence applications based on their risk to cause harm.\nRAG #2\n(LlamaIndex)\nThe document is about a proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (the AI Act) and its main elements, including subject matter and scope, technical documentation, and processing of personal data.\nRAG #3\n(Langchain)\nThe document is about technical documentation referred to in Annex IV, which includes documentation concerning changes approved by notified bodies, decisions and other documents issued by notified bodies, and the EU declaration of conformity referred to in Article 48. The Member States determine the conditions under which the documentation remains at the disposal of national competent authorities. The document also outlines systems and procedures for record-keeping and resource management.\nRAG #1\n(DocLLM)\nThere are multiple documents provided. The first document (AI_Act.pdf-129)\ncontains information on the technical documentation that providers of high-risk AI systems must maintain, as well as the automatically generated logs that must be kept. The second document (AI_Act.pdf-10) is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence. The third document (AI_Act.pdf-1)\nprovides information on the negotiation process and main elements of the compromise for the proposed regulation. The fourth document\n(AI_Act.pdf-172) contains information on codes of practice for the proper application of the regulation.\nGraphRAG #1\n(DocLLM)\nThis document is about the regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in the European Union.
